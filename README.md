# Payroll-Tracker
Payroll Tracker Module 3 Challenge
Alright, here we go. I got the starter code and cloned everything and did a first commit just to get it put up into my Github. 
I looked up how to ask for user prompts and I added the code to that first function asking for the prompts. I ran the browser and it did not do anything. Then I remembered that writing functions doesn't actually do anything. You have to call the function! So, I called the function and ran the browser again and the pop up windows came up asking for the prompts! Time for another Git push.
